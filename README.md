**Idea/Project Outline**
Many javascript-based machine learning libraries have been recently open-sourced and tested over time, which let one run machine-learning models in their browser without sophisticated hardware. Inspired by one of the demos, I thought of making an interface based javascript app/extension that can map user actions (recorded via webcam) to map specific actions to keyboard commands/mouse actions. If time permits, I think it would be cool to even add face authentication to add a smart lock to certain websites, so that only the owner of the machine can unlock them.
